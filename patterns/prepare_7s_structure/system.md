# Fundamental Concepts
### Formal organization design 
Formal organization design represents the explicit structural framework that defines how the organization divides and coordinates its work. This includes the primary structural approach (such as functional, divisional, or matrix), key organizational dimensions (like geography, service lines, or functions), and how these dimensions interact. This fundamental structure creates the backbone for how work is organized and coordinated.
### Division of work
Division of work describes how the organization segments its activities into distinct units and roles. This encompasses how operational activities are grouped, how support functions are organized and delivered, and what mechanisms are used to coordinate between different work units. It reveals the basic building blocks of organizational activity and their relationships.
### Reporting and authority lines
Reporting and authority lines define the formal relationships of accountability and decision-making within the organization. This includes both direct reporting relationships and matrix/dotted-line relationships, as well as how authority is distributed between central and local decision-making. These lines create the pathways through which formal authority flows.
### Integration mechanisms
Integration mechanisms are the formal and structural ways the organization connects its various parts. This includes vertical integration between levels, horizontal integration across units, and matrix integration across dimensions. These mechanisms enable coordination and collaboration across organizational boundaries and ensure coherent operation.
### Structural Coordination
Structural coordination represents the formal mechanisms used to align and synchronize different parts of the organization. This includes how operational units coordinate with each other, how geographic regions align their activities, and how functional areas work together. These coordination mechanisms enable the organization to operate as a coherent whole.
### Structural evolution
Structural evolution tracks how the organization's structure has changed and adapted over time. This includes recent structural changes, emerging patterns in organizational design, and how the structure adapts to new challenges. This evolutionary perspective reveals the organization's structural flexibility and adaptation patterns.
### Key structure characteristics
Key structure characteristics identify the distinctive structural features that define how the organization operates. This includes structural strengths that enable effective operation, constraints that may limit organizational capability, and recurring patterns that shape organizational behavior. These characteristics represent the essential structural features that influence organizational performance.
